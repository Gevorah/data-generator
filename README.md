# data-generator
Data Generator is a simulation software, which is responsible for generating people with random data, this action can be performed in two ways, generating the maximum number of users allowed by the program or entering the number of users desired, as well as creating a single person manually entering data.
On the other hand, through this software the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) are carried out, that is, the program allows the user to search for a person, delete him or her or edit his information (except for the code) since this is generated and it is unique when the person is registered.

Instructions for use
1) when the program is opened in the upper left, you can choose whether to search or create a person
2) If you chose to create, it offers you the option of creating a single user by filling in the data manually or you can enter a number of people you want to create
3) If you want to create the limit of allowed users, just leave the user field empty and press the create button
4) If your option is to search, you can enter the person's code and make the option to edit, delete, search or view the user's information
5) The application has a "Back" button that is useful to return to the start of the screen at any desired time

This software is designed in the JAVA programming language
